# Library Management App - Backend

## Overview

The Library Management App Backend is designed to manage core library operations such as book inventory, user management, borrowing and returning books, book reservations, and user reviews. This RESTful API provides librarians and users with a seamless interface for managing library resources, while administrators have enhanced control over users and content. The system also features interactive API documentation powered by Swagger for easy integration and testing.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and view books in the library collection.
- **User Management**: Register and manage users, with different roles (e.g., librarian, regular user).
- **Borrowing System**: Users can borrow and return books, with tracking of due dates and overdue fines.
- **Book Reservation**: Users can reserve books, manage reservations, and view their history.
- **Review and Rating**: Users can rate and review borrowed books.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login and registration using JWT tokens for user authentication.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Librarians can manage users and books through the admin interface.
- **API Documentation**: Interactive API documentation with Swagger UI.
